# go-gitdiff

A Go library for parsing and applying patches generated by `git diff`, `git
show`, and `git format-patch`. It can also parse and apply unified diffs
generated by the standard `diff` tool.

It supports both standard line-oriented / text patches and Git binary patches.

## Status

In development, most functionality is currently missing, incomplete, or broken.

## Why another git/unified diff parser?

[Several][sourcegraph] [packages][sergi] with [similar][waigani]
[functionality][seletskiy] exist, so why did I write another?

1. No other packages I found support binary diffs, as generated with the
   `--binary` flag. This is the main reason for writing a new packages, as the
   format is pretty different from line-oriented diffs and is unique to Git.

2. Most other packages only parse patches, so you need another package to apply
   them (and if they do support applies, it is only for text files.)

3. This package aims to accept anything<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> that `git
   apply` accepts, and closely follows the logic in [`apply.c`][apply.c].

4. It seemed like a fun thing to write and a good way to learn more about Git.

<sup id="f1">1</sup> In practice this library is stricter than `git apply` when
given certain types of invalid input, particularly lines that contain garbage
following the valid content. Git seems to ignore this in some cases, while this
library will usually return an error.

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. The translation from C to Go may have introduced inconsistencies in the way
   unicode file names are handled; please report any issues of this type.
